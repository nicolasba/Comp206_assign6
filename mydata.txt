Hi Everyone,

Metro was down Monday morning so I missed the 9:30 class. I did make it for the 10:30 class.

This Wednesday I will hold an additional 9:30 class to review the material from Monday. See the slides I posted. In addition to information about the final are problems to try out. I will do some of those problems in class on Wednesday.

Don't forget course evaluations.

Joseph
